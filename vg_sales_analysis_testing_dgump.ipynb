    "Video game are an increasingly popular pass-time. As technology has progressed, so too has the potential for games to create a fun and memorable experience. Titles are produced on all scales, from one-person projects to blockbuster-level endeavors. The market for games likewise benefits from burgeoning popularity. The demographics of gamers is wider than ever before. By analyzing which genres of games sell better, the following research aims to inform where publishers might focus their interest and assist developers in making their projects more marketable. "

    "The distributions for the sales by genres were all heavily skewed, but at least one had a significantly different median than the others. The post hoc testing showed a significant difference between action and shooter games. It was expected that these two genres would sell similarly, since both have similar elements of high energy and violence. The difference may that shooters appeal to more competitve, skill based gamers, while action games appeal to people wanted a fast paced but character driven experience. Shooters outperformed action games. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were also significant differences in the medians for role-playing games compared to shooter games, and in the medians action games compared to strategy games. These differences were to be expected, since these two pairs compare a fast-paced violent genre to a slower, more intellectual genre. What was unexpected was there was no significant difference in the means of fighting and platform games. Since platforming games, like the Mario franchise, are less violent and competitve than fighting games like Mortal Combat, it was expected the fighting games would sell more, for same speculated reasons that shooters and action games outperformed the slower genres they were compared to. Upon further consideration, both platforming and fighting games focus on speed and knowledge of the levels (for platformers) or playable character (for fighting games). At the same time, both appeal to wide audiences as games with low barriers of entry. The Mario franchise is ubiqutious, and fighting games are easy to boot-up and start a match. \n",
    "\n",
    "The common language effect size for the three significantly different pairs compared were all about 0.55, meaning that a game chosen at random from one genre that sold better than other was not much better than chance. Genre likely does not have a large impact on well a game sells. "

    "### Limitations and Future Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "An important feature of this data is that most entries barely made the list for sales. The raw data had values of zero sales in North America up until the 50th percentile, where the value was 0.08 million units. This makes sense, as the barrier for entry into gaming is incredibly small. Any one with a little coding and art skills can make and publish a game. Likewise, most of the games made are going to reach a very small, incidental audience. The games that sold the best also benefit from name recognition, and the backing of large publishing studios. A future analysis focusing on independently published games would inform us about how smaller budget games sell while discounting unlovingly made cash-grab titles by bigger publishers. Similarly, the big-budget games can be analyzed on their own to see how to large titles compare to each other. The marketing budget for a game would correlate with the prominence of the publishing studio, and is an important feature to consider when the sale of any product is being analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future analysis would also benefit from a greater variety of descriptive features. Features such as colorfulness, accessibility, speed of play, and length of game are just some examples that might influence someone's decision to purchase. These potential features may also better quanitfy why some games sold better while transcending the sometimes arbitrary idea of genre. "
